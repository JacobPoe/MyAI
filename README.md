# How to start the project:

In the root folder of the project (the folder where app.py lives), run one of the following two commands:

A) `python app.py caption`

- This command will run a server at http://0.0.0.0:7860
- This server is capable of accepting an image as an input and outputting a simple description of that image

B) `python app.py chat`

- This command will activate a chatbot built using OpenAI Community's GPT2-XL model
